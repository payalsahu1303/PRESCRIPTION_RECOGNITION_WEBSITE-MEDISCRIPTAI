# MediScriptAI  

 **Project developed for CodeCraft Hackathon 2025 by CodeTru**  

This project focuses on **handwritten prescription recognition** using **OCR technology**. It extracts text from uploaded medical prescriptions, making them readable and accessible.

##  Usage Guide  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Upload a prescription image** (JPEG, PNG)  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Image is preprocessed** (grayscale & resized)  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **OCR extracts text** from the prescription  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Copy & use the extracted text**

##  OCR Processing & Preprocessing  

### üîπ Preprocessing the Image for Better Accuracy  
Before performing OCR, the image undergoes enhancement to improve text extraction:  

‚úÖ Converts image to **grayscale**  
‚úÖ Adjusts **brightness & contrast**  
‚úÖ Resizes image for **better OCR performance**  

### üîπ OCR Workflow  
- Uses **Tesseract.js** to recognize text  
- Extracted text is displayed in **UI**  
- Users can **copy the text to clipboard**

##  Model Training & Accuracy Improvement  

We improved OCR accuracy by:  
üîπ Using **EasyOCR & Tesseract.js** together for better results  
üîπ Applying **data augmentation** to train on handwritten prescriptions  
üîπ Preprocessing text with **grayscale conversion & denoising**  

##  Team Analysis  

Our team worked collaboratively to build the **Doctor Prescription Recognition App** for the **CodeCraft Hackathon 2025 by CodeTru**. Each member played a crucial role in different aspects of the project, ensuring a successful and well-rounded solution.
